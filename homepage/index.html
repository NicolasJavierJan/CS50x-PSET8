        <p>Nicolás Javier Jan (Buenos Aires, Argentina, August 1990) is an amazing human/musician. In this page, you can read about
        Nico's life and hobbies.</p>


        <h2>Life</h2>
        <p>Nico was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in August 1990. He had a nice and fun childhood. He enjoyed playing with his toys,
        reading, watching tv, and running between the sprinklers in summer. He started studying violin at age eight, but became bored easily,
        and stopped going to classes. At age seventeen he re-discovered his violin and decided to go to classes again, and this proved to be
        a milestone in his life (more info about this <a href="music.html">here</a>).</p>

        <p>Nico moved a couple of times because of his father's work, and also travelled along all of Argentina. This broadened his horizons,
        and make him understand from a young age that the world was indeed a big place. This, along with his natural ability to learn
        languages, made him passionate about travelling and languages (more info about this <a href="languages.html">here</a>).</p>

        <p>Before starting studying music, Nico was also very bad at sports. He didn't feel the same kind of satisfaction from physical
        activity that he felt with mental activity, so he didn't play a lot of games or sports. This changed when he started playing the
        violin, because he read somewhere that "the body and mind both need to be active to be a balanced person". This really hit him,
        and so he started looking for an activity he enjoyed doing. It took some time, but he finally found it (more info about this
        <a href="aikido.html">here</a>).</p>
