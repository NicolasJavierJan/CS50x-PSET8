        <h1>Aikido</h1>
        <h1>合気道</h1>
        <p>Aikido is a modern Japanese martial art developed by Morihei Ueshiba as a synthesis of his martial studies, philosophy and religious beliefs.
        Ueshiba's goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attackers from injury.
        Aikido is often translated as "the way of unifying (with) life energy" or as "the way of harmonious spirit". According to the founder's philosophy,
        the primary goal in the practice of aikido is to overcome oneself instead of cultivating violence or aggressiveness.</p>
        <p>Aikido's fundamental principles include: irimi (entering), atemi, kokyu-ho (breathing control), sankaku-ho (triangular principle)
        and tenkan (turning) movements that redirect the opponent's attack momentum. Its curriculum comprises various techniques, primarily throws and
        joint locks. It also includes a weapons system encompassing the bokken, tantō and jō.</p>

        to try a class. His first impression was that of a noble martial art, with a great deal of respect for his training partners and extra precautions
        to make sure that everyone was always ok and there was no pain involved in the techiques. As a <a href="music.html">musician</a>, Nico found this very important.</p>
        <p>He started attending Aikido classes three times a week, and by the time he had his Orange Belt, he started going to classes almost every day.
        After his Green Belt exam, he started to take Aikido a little easier, and went to classes two or three times a week again.</p>
        <p>In his <a href="languages.html">2019 Japan Travel</a> he went to the Aikikai Hombu Dojo and took a class with Osawa Hayato Sensei.</p>
        <p>Nico is currently a Brown Belt and is preparing his Black Belt examination.</p>
