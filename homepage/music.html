        <h1>Musical Life</h1>
        <h2>Violin</h2>
        <p><a href="index.html">Nico</a> attended his first violin class when he was eight years old. Bored by the formal approach of the classes, he soon stopped going.
        At age seventeen he rediscovered his violin and decided to go back to classes, so he enrolled in the Juan José Castro Conservatory. There he met his
        teacher, Jacinto. </p>
        <p>Nico, at first, was awful with the instrument. He was always nervous and didn't know how to tackle the difficulties of the violin. But with time,
        he started getting better. He practiced more and more everyday, decided to make a career out of it.</p>
        <p>In 2020, as part of his <a href="languages.html">European Travel</a> he went to Aarhus, Denmark, to audition for a place in the Conservatory
        of Music. Sadly, he didn't get it.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center">The orchestra years</h3>
        <p>Nico started playing the violin in the Conservatory Orchestra in 2012 (about the same time he started <a href="aikido.html">Aikido</a>.
        He learned a lot there, and made friends and music.</p>
        <p>In 2013 his teacher told him about a String Orchestra and Nico auditioned and got in. The Encuentro Orchestra was the best orchestra he ever
        been to, because of the emphasis they made about "music and feelings".</p>

        <h2>Piano</h2>
        <p>In 2012, he entered the UCA in Buenos Aires to learn Musical Composition. He had to learn to play the piano. It was difficult to him, as he
        was used to the violin, and it felt a lot like learning a new language. He wasn't bad at it, but it was really difficult. He left the UCA in 2015.</p>
        <p>He also had piano classes in the Conservatory.</p>

        <h2>Bassoon</h2>
        <p>In the year 2017 he started attending Bassoon classes in the Conservatory, because he wanted to learn a different instrument. He found out the
        sound and the colour of the basoon charming. He did two full years, but had to quit classes because he didn't had his own bassoon, and they are
        crazy expensive.</p>

        <h2>Guitar</h2>
        <p>Nico took guitar classes in the Conservatory. He also played electric guitar with his friends in the band "Artista Desconocido".</p>

        <h2>Other instruments</h2>
        <p>Apart from all this, Nico has a viola and a mandolin. He plays them for fun, occasionally playing video games tunes.</p>
