        <h1>Travel and Languages</h1>
        <p><a href="index.html">Nico</a> found out early in his life that he can learn languages without much effort. Through the years, he has taken classes of a
        lot of languages, and he has the plan to continue them in the future. On the other hand, Nico also loves travelling, so whenever he travels, he tries
        to put into practice what he knows of the languages he studied.</p>

        <h2>Languages</h2> <!-- aca podria hacer una tabla...? -->
        <p>Being born in Argentina, he is fluent in Spanish.</p>
        <p>He started his English classes in primary school.</p>
        <p>His grandparents are Slovenian, so he attended Slovenian classes when he was young.</p>
        <p>In secondary school, he had a year of French.</p>
        <p>In 2019 he started attending Japanese classes (altough he already knew some words from <a href="aikido.html">aikido</a>!).</p>
        <p>Also in 2019 he took Danish classes (they proved useful for his <a href="music.html">audition</a>!).</p>
        <p>In 2020, thanks to CS50, Nico learned new languages: C, Python, HTML and JavaScript.</p>
